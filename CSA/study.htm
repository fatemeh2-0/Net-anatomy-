<h1 align="center">Suggested Mode of Study</h1>
<p>The authors suggest the following approach to the study of the cross-sectional anatomy depicted at NetAnatomy. First read the textual description of a body system, e.g. cardiovascular, and note in the simultaneously depicted Low Power image the location of the principle structures described. Then immediately go to the High Power image and, using the Explore feature, identify the structures just observed at Low Power. After identifying the structures at High Power, return to Low Power and select the next body system, e.g. respiratory. Going from Low to High Power within a single body system will facilitate an appreciation for the identity and organization of the major anatomical structures in the cross-sections. After examining all body systems on Low and High Power, take the Test.</p>
<p>The Test is designed to assess your ability to identify the major structures in a cross-section. The Test consists of thinking of the name of the structure to which a pointer is directed and then self-checking your answer by revealing the structure name. While consideration was given to providing a “list of matching answers”, when you get to a situation where you will need to identify a structure in a cross-sectional view, e.g. a laboratory practical or a clinical rotation, it is unlikely that the question will come with a list of possible answers. Relative to “typed” answer input, our experience suggests that in a self-testing situation students do not want to take the time to type an answer (and potentially edit the typing) when the underlying goal is simply to determine whether they can identify the structure by name.</p>
<p>Finally, examine the Correlation image(s) for each cadaveric cross-section. The Correlation images are designed to reinforce anatomical features first observed in the cadaveric cross-sections. The Correlation images are derived from a variety of sources, e.g. radiology, cadaveric soft tissues, bones, etc. that provide an alternative view of anatomical features seen in cross-section but whose anatomy is best appreciated when viewed in multiple dimensions and formats. Determine for yourself whether it is best to view the Correlation images before or after you take the Test.</p>

<h1 align="center">What is this website?</h1>

<p>NetAnatomy is designed to teach human anatomy to students of the health professions, including undergraduate medical, health sciences, and nursing students. NetAnatomy also serves as a place to review anatomy after one’s initial exposure to the subject, e.g. students beginning a clinical rotation, USMLE (National Board) preparation, etc. View
<a href="how_anatomical_content_is_select.htm"> how anatomical content is selected for inclusion</a> for information on the factors that govern anatomical content at this website.</p>

<p>Content will be added to NetAnatomy over time. We currently see no future point in time at which NetAnatomy will be considered "complete". Distribution via the Internet allows pertinent anatomical content to be readily added to all subject areas as new images and text that address the mission of NetAnatomy are acquired and developed; thus we view NetAnatomy as a continuously evolving website. Current development efforts are focused on Gross Anatomy. We hope you find the content of value and welcome your comments.</p>

<h1 align="center"><strong>Subscription</strong></h1>
<P>Effective August 1, 2007, access to the content of NetAnatomy.com will only
  be available through an institutional subscription. For an annual fee of $1,495
  (U.S. dollars), students, faculty, and staff can have access to the Radiographic
  Anatomy, Cross-Sectional Anatomy, and Gross Anatomy content of the website.
  There will be no limit to the number of concurrent users from subscribing institutions.
  Individual subscription purchases will not be available; if you would like
  access to the content contact your institution or organization to inquire about
  the purchase of a site license. The privilege of printing individual screens
  or pages for noncommercial educational purposes will be limited to members
  of subscribing institutions. We are making this announcement now to ensure
  users ample time to complete the academic year with uninterrupted free access.
  Increasing costs for development and maintenance of the website, coupled to
  a lack of sponsors and our strong aversion to advertise or sell products through
  the website, has resulted in this decision. </P>
<P>Institutions interested in purchasing a site license to NetAnatomy or seeking
  additional information should send an email to <a href="mailto:SES@NetAnatomy.com">SES@NetAnatomy.com</a> with the
  name and contact information of an institutional representative.</P>

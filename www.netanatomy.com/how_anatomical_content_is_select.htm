However human anatomy encompasses an enormous amount of information, much more than a medical, health sciences, or nursing student could fully master or, indeed, needs to master. Increased depths of anatomical knowledge are acquired by physicians and other health professionals when a clinical specialty is chosen, which further refines the anatomical knowledge base to be mastered. For “undifferentiated” medical, health sciences, and nursing students a certain baseline of clinically relevant anatomical knowledge needs to be mastered early in their education. The
<a href="why_trust_the_content.htm"> authors and contributors</a> of NetAnatomy have extensive experience teaching human anatomy to medical and health sciences students, years of experience refined and adapted to contemporary medical and health sciences curricula. Furthermore, two prominent anatomical organizations, the American Association of Clinical Anatomists and the Association of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Neurobiology Chairpersons, charged working groups of their members with the task of assessing the anatomical content appropriate for undergraduate medical students of the 21st century. The published works of these organizations, i.e., “A Clinical Anatomy Curriculum for the Medical Student of the 21st Century: Gross Anatomy”,

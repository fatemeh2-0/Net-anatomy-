<!--USMLE Type Examination Questions Part I of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), i.e. the "National  Boards", includes questions whose answers are based on a knowledge of  anatomy. The exam questions are often based on a brief clinical scenario. All  USMLE Part I exams are computer-based. Like Part I of the USMLE you can  make your answer selection either by clicking it with the mouse or selecting the  appropriate letter key on the keyboard. You can also change your mind and  make another selection. Unlike the USMLE you will in this exam need to press  the "Accept Answer" button. The Accept Answer feature enables you to receive  immediate feedback on the answer, unlike the USMLE where selecting the Next  button accepts your answer and moves you to the next question. A USMLE  exam does not provide feedback to your responses; immediate feedback is  provided in this exam in order to enhance the educational value of the exam.  Indeed, an explanation of the correct answer is provided even when you select  the correct response (just in case you guessed). Even though you are provided  immediate feedback, you will still receive a final examination score at the end of  the 20 questions.  Select the best answer. Questions 1 through 5 relate to Mr. Williams, a 59-year-old male admitted  to the emergency room with chest pain suggestive of a heart attack.  Following stabilization, coronary angiography is ordered. In order to insert  a catheter into the opening of either the right or left coronary artery, which  of the following initial entrance sites would provide relatively convenient  access and the most direct route to the coronary arteries? USMLE Questions: Item 1 of 20 A. left subclavian vein B. right pulmonary artery C. left femoral vein D. right femoral artery E. right 1st posterior intercostal artery Wrong. Only the right femoral artery (choice D) provides near direct  access to the coronary arteries via its continuity with the external and  common iliac arteries and then the aorta; the latter consisting  retrogradely of the descending aorta, arch of the aorta, and  ascending aorta from which the coronary arteries originate. The veins  (A and C) and right pulmonary artery (B) would require catherization  through the pulmonary circulation - an impossibility.  The right 1st  posterior intercostal artery (E) is not readily accessible and would be  very difficult to locate and catherize because of its size. Correct. The right femoral artery provides near direct access to the coronary  arteries via its continuity with the external and common iliac arteries and  then the aorta; the latter consisting retrogradely of the descending aorta,  arch of the aorta, and ascending aorta from which the coronary arteries  originate. The veins (A and C) and right pulmonary artery (B) would require  catherization through the pulmonary circulation - an impossibility.  The right  1st posterior intercostal artery (E) is not readily accessible and would be  very difficult to locate and catherize because of its size. The coronary angiogram of Mr. Williams reveals  significant narrowing of the left anterior  descending (LAD) artery near its origin. Relative  to the conducting system of the heart, you would  be most concerned with the blood supply to the: USMLE Questions: Item 2 of 20 A. SA node B. AV node C. AV bundle D. internodal cardiac fibers  E. vagus nerve Wrong. The area of the heart supplied by the LAD artery  includes the interventricular  septum, within which the  AV bundle (syn. bundle of His) resides (choice C).  Blockage of the LAD with resulting ischemia of the  interventricular septum will result in death of the muscle  fibers in the AV bundle, which conducts the contraction  impulse from the AV node of the right atrium to the  typical cardiac muscle fibers of the ventricles.  Correct. The area of the heart supplied  by the LAD artery includes the  interventricular  septum, within which the  AV bundle (syn. bundle of His) resides.  The AV bundle conducts the contraction  impulse from the AV node in the right  atrium to the typical cardiac muscle  fibers of the ventricles.  Angioplasty (expansion of the narrowed LAD with a stent  inserted by catheter) is performed on Mr. Williams and results  are satisfactory. However, as part of the original admission the  attending physician noted an abnormal heart sound  designated on the patient's chart as occurring during S2. S2  refers to the near simultaneous closure of the patient's: USMLE Questions: Item 3 of 20 A. tricuspid and mitral valves. B. aortic and pulmonary valves. C. tricuspid and pulmonary valves D. mitral and aortic valves.  E. tricuspid and aortic valves. Wrong. S2 is the second heart sound,  created by the near simulataneous  closure of the aortic and pulmonary  valves (choice B) when the ventricles  relax at the beginning of diastole. The  retrograde flow of blood in the large  vessels causes the two valves to close. Correct. S2 is the second heart  sound, created by the near  simulataneous closure of the  aortic and pulmonary valves  when the ventricles relax at the  beginning of diastole. A split (separation of the two component heart sounds) of S2 is  best appreciated toward the end of deep inspiration. You would  position your stethoscope on Mr. Williams' chest just lateral to  the sternum over which of the following two intercostal spaces  in order to hear the two components of S2? USMLE Questions: Item 4 of 20 A. Left 2nd intercostal space and right 2nd intercostal space. B. Left 2nd intercostal space and left 5th intercostal space. C. Left 4th intercostal space and right 3rd intercostal space. D. Left 5th intercostal space and right 2nd intercostal space. E. Left 3rd intercostal space and right 3rd intercostal space. Wrong; choice A is correct.  The A2 (aortic) component of S2 is best heard over  the right 2nd intercostal space close to the sternum while the P2 (pulmonic)  component is best heard over the left 2nd intercostal space close to the sternum.  A2 and P2 are the closing of the aortic and pulmonary valves respectively and  best heard off the sternum (it muffles sound) in an area close to where the blood  carrying the sound has recently traveled; the ascending aorta rises to the sternal  angle (where the 2nd rib articulates with the sternum) while the pulmonary trunk  lies just to the left of the aorta close to the sternal angle.  Correct. The A2 (aortic) component of S2 is best heard over the right 2nd  intercostal space close to the sternum while the P2 (pulmonic) component is  best heard over the left 2nd intercostal space close to the sternum. A2 and  P2 are the closing of the aortic and pulmonary valves respectively and best  heard off the sternum (it muffles sound) in an area close to where the blood  carrying the sound has recently traveled; the ascending aorta rises to the  sternal angle (where the 2nd rib articulates with the sternum) while the  pulmonary trunk lies just to the left of the aorta close to the sternal angle.  When Mr. Williams takes a deep breath, all of the  following statements concerning his deep inspiration are  correct EXCEPT: A. His diaphragm has descended following contraction       under phrenic nerve stimulation. B. The pressure within the respiratory air spaces of his      lungs has decreased. C. The anterior borders of his lungs have moved medially      into his costomediastinal recesses. D. The vertical heights of his costodiaphragmatic recesses      have increased. E. His sternum has moved anteriorly and superiorly     concurrent with elevation of his ribs. USMLE Questions: Item 5 of 20 Wrong; statement D is incorrect. During  inspiration the vertical heights of the  costodiaphragmatic recesses decrease, not  increase. This reflects the descent of the  diaphragm and concurrent descent of the  bases of the lungs as the lungs expand into,  and reduce, the costodiaphragmatic recesses. Correct. During inspiration the vertical heights  of the costodiaphragmatic recesses decrease,  not increase. This reflects the descent of the  diaphragm and concurrent descent of the bases  of the lungs as the lungs expand into, and  reduce, the costodiaphragmatic recesses. Questions 6 and 7 relate to 1-year-old Jennifer Smith who  is scheduled to undergo surgical correction of a patent  ductus arteriosus. During the surgery accurate  identification of the ductus arteriosus will be made based  on the knowledge that it is connected at either end to the: A. ascending aorta and right pulmonary artery. D. left superior pulmonary vein and arch of the aorta. C. descending aorta and left pulmonary artery. B. arch of the aorta and pulmonary trunk. E. left atrium and pulmonary trunk. USMLE Questions: Item 6 of 20 Wrong; choice B is correct. The ductus  arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that connects  the underside of the arch of the aorta with the  superior surface of the pulmonary trunk. The  ductus arteriosus allows much of the fetal  blood (about 75%) entering the pulmonary  trunk to bypass the pulmonary circulation,  which in the fetus offers high resistence to  blood flow.  Correct. The ductus arteriosus is a fetal  blood vessel that connects the underside of  the arch of the aorta with the superior  surface of the pulmonary trunk. The ductus  arteriosus allows much of the fetal blood  (about 75%) entering the pulmonary trunk to  bypass the pulmonary circulation, which in  the fetus offers high resistence to blood flow. In the surgical correction of patent ductus arteriosus,  the surgeon must be conscious of laryngeal motor  nerve fibers that originally descended through the  superior thoracic aperture within the: A. right phrenic nerve B. left phrenic nerve C. right greater splanchnic nerve D. right vagus nerve E. left vagus nerve USMLE Questions: Item 7 of 20 Wrong; choice E is correct. The left vagus nerve carries voluntary  motor nerve fibers destined for the left side of the larynx into the  thorax. The laryngeal nerve fibers branch from the left vagus  nerve in the thorax as the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The left  recurrent laryngeal nerve in turn loops under the arch of the aorta  in close proximity to the ductus arteriosus as it ascends out of  the thorax to reach the larynx; surgical damage to these nerve  fibers will result in paralysis of some laryngeal muscles with  resulting permanent hoarseness in the voice. Correct. The left vagus nerve carries voluntary motor nerve  fibers destined for the left side of the larynx into the thorax.  The laryngeal nerve fibers branch from the left vagus nerve in  the thorax as the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The left  recurrent laryngeal nerve in turn loops under the arch of the  aorta in close proximity to the ductus arteriosus as it ascends  out of the thorax to reach the larynx; surgical damage to  these nerve fibers will result in paralysis of some laryngeal  muscles with resulting permanent hoarseness in the voice. Questions 8 through 10 relate to a 32-year-old male, Robert Jones, admitted to the  Emergency Room in a semiconscious state with a bullet wound from a hand gun.  Visual inspection reveals that the bullet pierced the right 6th intercostal space at  the midaxillary line. The volume of blood suggests a deep wound and air moving  in and out of the entrance site during respiration suggests that at a minimum the  right pleural cavity has been pierced. Assuming a straight projectile into the chest  perpendicular to the body surface, it is likely that the bullet would also have: USMLE Questions: Item 8 of 20 A. pierced the upper lobe of the right lung. B. pierced the middle lobe of the right lung. C. pierced the lower lobe of the right lung. E. avoided lung tissue and traversed the right costodiaphragmatic     recess and  subsequently entered the abdomen. D. pierced the apex of the right lung. Wrong. The bullet would have entered the lower lobe of the right  lung (choice C), reflecting the fact that the oblique fissure of the  right lung crosses the midaxillary line at the level of the 5th rib;  hence the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line overlies the  lower lobe of the lung. The full approximate course of the oblique  fissure, inferior to which lies the lower lobe, is posteriorly from the  spine of T3 to the 6th rib at the midclavicular line anteriorly.  Correct. The bullet would have entered the lower lobe of the right  lung, reflecting the fact that the oblique fissure of the right lung  crosses the midaxillary line at the level of the 5th rib; hence the  6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line overlies the lower  lobe of the lung. The full approximate course of the oblique  fissure, inferior to which lies the lower lobe, is posteriorly from  the spine of T3 to the 6th rib at the midclavicular line anteriorly.  Lateral and PA chest films reveal that the bullet  struck Mr. Jones' vertebral column and ricocheted  anteriorly. The bullet failed to enter the heart but  appears to be lodged in the structure immediately  posterior to the base of the heart. If confirmed with  CT scan, the bullet will need to be removed from the: USMLE Questions: Item 9 of 20 A. lower lobe of the left lung. C. thoracic duct. B. esophagus. D. trachea. E. descending thoracic aorta. Wrong. The bullet is likely lodged in the  esophagus (choice B), which lies directly  posterior to the base of the heart. The base of  the heart lies on the posterior aspect of the  organ and is comprised primarily of left atrium. Correct. The bullet is likely lodged in the  esophagus, which lies directly posterior to  the base of the heart. The base of the heart   lies on the posterior aspect of the organ and  is comprised primarily of left atrium. A pre-operative series of CT scans are  taken between the T5 and T10 vertebrae to  assess soft tissue damage and more  accurately localize the bullet. Which of the  following structures could NOT be  assessed in this series of CT scans? USMLE Questions: Item 10 of 20 A. azygos vein B. descending thoracic aorta E. aortic arch  D. thoracic duct C. left primary bronchus Wrong. The aortic arch (choice E) lies in  the superior mediastinum, which in turn  lies above the T4 - T5 intervertebral disc.  Hence the aortic arch cannot be seen in a  CT series that begins as low as the T5  vertebra. All of the other structures lie in  the inferior mediastinum, below the T4 - T5  Correct. The aortic arch lies in the superior  mediastinum, which in turn lies above the  T4 - T5 intervertebral disc. Hence the aortic  arch cannot be seen in a CT series that  begins as low as the T5 vertebra. As you are  aware, all of the other structures lie in the  inferior mediastinum, below the T4 - T5  Question 11 and 12 relate to a 24-year-old  female, Carol Blackwell, who is referred to you  for a second opinion regarding mitral valve  prolapse. The associated murmur would best be  heard by placing your stethoscope over the: USMLE Questions: Item 11 of 20 A. left 2nd intercostal space close to the sternum. B. left 4th intercostal space close to the sternum. C. right 2nd intercostal space close to the sternum. D. left 5th intercostal space close to the midclavicular line. E. right 4th intercostal space close to the sternum. Wrong; the correct answer is choice  D.  The mitral valve (syn. bicuspid  valve) is best heard over the apex of  the heart, which in an adult lies near  the left 5th intercostal space 7 to 9 cm  from the midsternal line, placing it just  medial to the midclavicular line. Correct. The mitral valve (syn. bicuspid  valve) is best heard over the apex of the  heart, which in an adult lies near the left  5th intercostal space 7 to 9 cm from the  midsternal line, placing it just medial to  the midclavicular line. Having confirmed in Ms. Blackwell a  murmur consistent with mitral valve  prolapse, you appreciate that in this  patient there is regurgitation of blood: USMLE Questions: Item 12 of 20 A. into the left atrium during systole. B. into the left atrium during diastole. C. into the right atrium during systole. D. into the right atrium during diastole. E. into both atria during both diastole and systole. Wrong; the correct answer is choice A.  The mitral valve prevents a  regurgitation  or backflow of blood from the lumen of  the left ventricle to the lumen of the left  atrium when the left ventricle of the heart  contracts during the systole phase of the  cardiac cycle. Correct. The mitral valve prevents a   regurgitation or backflow of blood from  the lumen of the left ventricle to the  lumen of the left atrium when the left  ventricle of the heart contracts during  the systole phase of the cardiac cycle. Physical diagnosis and an electrocardiogram of a 58-year-old  male suggests that the sinuatrial (SA) node may be in distress  due to coronary artery disease. Subsequent coronary  angiography reveals that the lumen of the artery from which the  SA nodal artery arises has narrowed signficantly. Therapeutic  dilation of which of the following arteries would be required? USMLE Questions: Item 13 of 20 A. circumflex branch of left coronary artery B. left anterior descending (LAD) branch of the left coronary artery C. posterior interventricular branch of the right coronary artery D. right marginal artery E. right coronary artery Wrong. The artery to the sinu-atrial  node typically arises directly from the  right coronary artery (choice E), shortly  after the right coronary artery itself  originates from the ascending aorta. Correct. The artery to the sinu-atrial  node typically arises directly from the  right coronary artery, shortly after the  right coronary artery itself originates  from the ascending aorta. In a plain PA chest film of a normal adult all  of the following are evident EXCEPT the: USMLE Questions: Item 14 of 20 A. apex of the heart. C. inferior vena cava. B. inferior border of the heart. D. pulmonary trunk. E. right border of the heart. Wrong. All of the structures are evident in a PA  chest film except the inferior border of the heart  (choice B), which is where the anterior  (sternocostal) surface of the heart transitions  with the diaphragmatic surface. The heart rests  upon the anterior slope of the diaphragm and  the inferior border is obscured by the densely  radio-opague underlying liver. Correct. All of the structures are evident in a  PA chest film except the inferior border of the  heart, which is where the anterior  (sternocostal) surface of the heart transitions  with the diaphragmatic surface. The heart  rests upon the anterior slope of the diaphragm  and the inferior border is obscured by the  densely radio-opague underlying liver. A 33-year-old female presents with a small  palpable mass located in the lower medial  quadrant of the right breast 3 cm from the nipple.  Although you appreciate lymphatic anastomoses  among the breasts, the principle lymphatic  drainage from the area of the lesion is to: USMLE Questions: Item 15 of 20 A. apical axillary lymph nodes. B. pectoral lymph nodes. C. intercostal lymph nodes. D. parasternal lymph nodes. E. anterior mediastinal lymph nodes. Wrong. The lymphatic vessels from  the medial halves of the breasts drain  to parasternal lymph nodes (choice D)  located adjacent to the sternum in the  neighboring intercostal spaces.  Correct. The lymphatic vessels from  the medial halves of the breasts  drain to parasternal lymph nodes  located adjacent to the sternum in  the neighboring intercostal spaces.  Closure of the pulmonary valve is due to: USMLE Questions: Item 16 of 20 A. contraction of the fibrous ring of the pulmonary orifice. B. increased tension of chorda tendineae. C. contraction of the right ventricle. E. retrograde blood flow within the pulmonary trunk. D. relaxation of the right atrium. Wrong. The pulmonary valve closes due to  retrograde blood flow within the pulmonary  trunk (choice E), the blood accumulating in  the sinuses of the valve cusps and pushing  them into the closed position. The  retrograde blood flow in turn results from  the relaxation of the right ventricle.  Correct. The pulmonary valve closes due  to retrograde blood flow within the  pulmonary trunk, the blood accumulating  in the sinuses of the valve cusps and  pushing them into the closed position.  The retrograde blood flow in turn results  from the relaxation of the right ventricle.  The dominant features of clinically defined  diastole include all of the following EXCEPT: USMLE Questions: Item 17 of 20 A. Contraction of the right atrium. B. An open tricuspid valve. C. Contracted papillary muscles. D. A closed aortic valve. E. Relaxation of the left atrium. Wrong; statement C is incorrect.  During diastole the ventricles are in a  state of relaxation. Papillary muscles,  which only occur within the ventricles,  contract and relax in concert with all  other ventricular musculature. Thus  during diastole papillary muscles are  relaxed, not contracted. Correct. During diastole the ventricles are in a  state of relaxation. Papillary muscles, which  only occur within the ventricles, contract and  relax in concert with all other ventricular  musculature. Thus during diastole papillary  muscles are relaxed, not contracted. All of the following statements regarding positions of the  respiratory passages are correct EXCEPT: USMLE Questions: Item 18 of 20 A. The trachea can be palpated by pressing a finger      into the neck directly above the jugular notch. B. The trachea lies anterior to the esophagus at the      superior thoracic aperture. C. The primary (main) bronchi arise from the trachea      near the level of the sternal angle. D. The left main bronchus passes superior to the arch of the aorta. E. The right main bronchus passes posterior to the      superior vena cava. Wrong; statement D is incorrect. The left  main (primary) bronchus passes inferior,  not superior, to the arch of the aorta.  Correct. The left main bronchus  passes inferior, not superior, to  the arch of the aorta.  The pain associated with pericarditis (inflammation  of the pericardium) is due to the innervation of the  fibrous pericardium and the parietal layer of  serous pericardium by sensory nerve fibers in the: USMLE Questions: Item 19 of 20 A. vagus nerves. B. greater splanchnic nerves. C. 4th through 6th intercostal nerves. D. pulmonary plexus.  E. phrenic nerves. Wrong. The pericardium receives  sensory pain fibers from the phrenic  nerves (choice E). The phrenic  nerves (C3, C4, and C5) descend  directly over the pericardium en  route to the diaphragm. Correct. The pericardium does receive  sensory pain fibers from the phrenic  nerves (C3, C4, and C5). The phrenic  nerves descend directly over the  pericardium en route to the diaphragm. All of the following can be attributed to efferent or  afferent nerve fibers in the vagus nerves EXCEPT: USMLE Questions: Item 20 of 20 A. bronchoconstriction. B. conduction of touch from the epithelial linings of      the respiratory passages. C. decrease in heart rate via the SA node. D. dilation of coronary arteries. E. monitoring blood pressure via baroreceptors in the     walls of the large blood vessels near the heart. Wrong; statement D is incorrect. The  vagus nerves are responsible for all of  the above except dilation of the  coronary arteries, which is attributable  to the sympathetic innervation of the  heart. Correct. The vagus nerves are  responsible for all of the above  except dilation of the coronary  arteries, which is attributable to  the sympathetic innervation of  the heart.

<h1 align="center">Educational Objectives</h1>
<p>No subject is more relevant to a physician or other health care provider than gross anatomy, which is the physical form in which a patient is viewed, either externally (e.g. during a physical exam) or internally (e.g. while performing or interpreting diagnostic and therapeutic procedures). For a health care provider not to have an appreciation for how the human body is structurally assembled, and how that assembly relates to its function, would be like taking your car to a mechanic who had little appreciation for the parts of the engine and how they interrelate. Gross anatomy also makes a significant contribution to the “medical language” that allows health care professionals to interact with each other in clear and precise terms; the anatomical portion of the language is learnt early in the educational process since it contributes so much to the foundation of the broader medical language.</p>
<p>While appreciating the significance of gross anatomy, like any discipline its incorporation into a curriculum must be measured. NetAnatomy is designed to present a foundation of gross anatomy that would be relevant to the "undifferentiated" student of the health professions; greater depths of anatomical knowledge can be acquired in other formats when a clinical specialty is chosen. NetAnatomy is not designed to teach clinical medicine and as such clinical information presented in the Anatomy Laboratory and the Clinical Notes of the Just-the-Facts section are designed to emphasize the clinical significance of the anatomy being learnt and to expand the vocabulary pertinent to clinical and applied anatomy. The educational objectives of understanding the gross structural and functional relationships of the human body, mastering the language that describes those relationships, and appreciating the clinical relevance of that content is the goal of
NetAnatomy.</p>
<p>Anatomy is a visual subject and as such the Anatomy Laboratory is an essential component in the study of human anatomy. However the authors of NetAnatomy also appreciate the value of print content that can serve as a convenient study guide in the absence of the visual imagery of the Anatomy Laboratory. The Just-the-Facts section is a concise presentation of anatomical information at a depth consistent with the goals of NetAnatomy and which can be printed for use as a study guide in the absence of the website. The print content of Just-the-Facts is available in the Adobe Acrobat Reader format; if you do not have the Acrobat Reader it can be downloaded free of charge by clicking on the Acrobat Reader icon below. The print context of Just-the-Facts must be used in accordance with the Licensing Agreement described at this website; a key item of the agreement is that the print content is for your own personal, individual use and it is not to be mass produced or redistributed in
anyway.</p>
